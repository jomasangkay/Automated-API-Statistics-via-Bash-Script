1) Install pre requisuite (Run commands via CMD)
- GitBash/WSL 
command: wsl --install (This will require computer reboot, then it will ask you for new username and password for the WSL)
command: wsl -v (To check if installed)

1.1) After installing WSL (Open WSL and run below commands)
- NodeJS
command1: sudo apt-get update
command2: sudo apt install nodejs

- AWSCLI
command1: curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
command2: sudo apt install unzip
command3: unzip awscliv2.zip
command4: sudo ./aws/install

- Bc
command: sudo apt install bc

- jq
command: sudo apt install jq

2) Update AWS credentials and config
command1: cd ~/.aws
command2: nano config (Then under [default], add this " region = ap-southeast-1 ", to set the region. Hit CTRL+S to save and CTRL+X to exit
command3: nano credentials (under [default] again, paste the copied credentials from AWS except the very first top ex. "[319588890717_AC-PSG-EI-CXSSMO-PROD]")
command4: aws sts get-caller-identity (To check if it is already returning AWS Account such as UserId)

3) After setting up. Run the script
command1: cd <directory of the script> (For example, if drive C:/testscriptdirectory then use "cd /mnt/c/testingscriptdirectory")
command1.1: sample from command 1: cd /mnt/c/Users/jomai/Desktop/NCS/Bashscript/APIstatsBash
command2: ./apistats.sh #(Input Time only)
or
command2: ./apistatsfulldate #(Input Date and Time)


IMPORTANT NOTE
-before you run the bash script, make sure the APIstats_Extract.csv file is not open. 
Or else, script will receive an error = cannot remove 'APIstats_Extract.csv': Permission denied

-APIstats_Extract.csv will be sorted A to Z base on the AWS script, it will not follow exactly how it sorted
from our API Stats sheet, since this aws query runs the whole batch script. You can use the Macro keys to help you
sort it base on our api stats sheet (CTRL + SHIFT + D) and fill up the missing rows like GetTransactionHistory or etc. (Go to MACRO KEYS.txt)
